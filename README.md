# Take Back Control of your Software!

[Join the movement](http://eepurl.com/drZUrD)

## The GPL has failed

It tried to give power to users, but it only gave power to the developer community.

## Commercial closed source software is unnecessarily profitable

This is an inefficient market ripe for change.

## There is a middle ground

There is a middle ground yet to be achieved, we need a new license 
and a new business model, join me in giving the power of software back 
to normal people.

A new way of licensing / funding / building / selling software that brings balance to the world.

# Cookbook

I want to create a repeatable guide for creating these businesses, here are the resources you'll need.

* [the-license.md](the-license.md) - all created software will be under this license, this will be the banner we march under
* [the-business-model.md](the-business-model.md) - this is a model (like a franchise) for how to set one up yourself if you believe in the mission
