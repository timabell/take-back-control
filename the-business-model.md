So you have a license that is both user and business friendly,
but how do turn that into a functioning organisation that turns money into software
on behalf of the users?

This is an open question but here are my early thoughts:

* Digital agency style business - highly efficient use of money, multi-skilled teams comprising of at least:
  * Developers - gotta make it work
  * Designers - no-one likes an ugly product
  * Product people - who can find out what users want for their money

Some kind of funding model where people pay for the work to be done, I don't have strong opinions, I think we need
to do what works for the software / market in question, possibilities:

* Freemium
* Cloud hosting stuff / SaaS
* Per user licensing
* Crowd funding
* Donations

It is important that if one of these businesses goes bust or goes in a direction that is against the users' wishes
(such as suddenly selling the users to advertisers in spite of objections) that it is possible to essentially "fork"
the whole business. However there needs to be a bigger barrier than there is with the GPL which is self-destructively
trivial to fork. This is where the need for a new license comes in.
